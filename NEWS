NEWS/ChangeLog for RFmerge
--------------------------
0.1-10  21-May-2020
        o Updated version after CRAN reported an unnecessary 'RFmerge-internal.Rd' file, which was removed for this release.

0.1-9   12-May-2020
        o Updated version after CRAN reported an error in the vignette ("Invalid argument: 'cov' and 'mask' have different CRS !!"). this error was previously undetected because the package was tested with R-devel in combination with GEOS 3.5.1, GDAL 2.2.2, PROJ 4.9.2, while CRAN uses GEOS 3.8.1, GDAL 3.0.4, PROJ 7.0.0.

0.1-8   28-Apr-2020 (not public)
        o Updated version after CRAN reported a problem with the vignette when tested against R-devel.

0.1-7   27-Apr-2020 (not public)
        o 'rfmerge': sf::st_crs(x])[["epsg"]] was changed to 'sf::st_crs(x)$proj4string' for identifying the projection of a vectorial or raster object. This was due to a report from Edzer Pebema mentioning that the old call used a legacy 'crc' structure, which was changed in the new verison of the 'sf' package.
       
0.1-6   07-Jan-2020
        o 'rmarkdown' was added to 'Suggests' after failing a new CRAN test.
        o the minimal vignette was modified to automatically set the 'parallel' argumento to 'paralell' or 'parallelWin' depending whether the OS is based on GNU/Linux or Windows, respectively.

0.1-5   04-Jan-2020
        o 'RFmerge-package.Rd': now the example correctly uses 2 cores as maximum when package is tested with the "--run-donttest" option

0.1-4   04-Jan-2020
        o DOI was added to the CITATION file and all the references within the package (the article was available online in January 2nd).
        o A maximum of two cores is used in all examples (fixed, with respect to the previous version).
        o Improved vignettes (minor details).

0.1-3   20-Dec-2019
        o 'RFmerge.R': new argument 'write2disk' to allow the user to choose whether the output merged layers should be written to disk or not. Default value is 'FALSE'. 
        o 'RFmerge.R': 'installed.packages()' was replaced by 'find.package', for increasing efficiency to find out if a named package is installed or not.
        o Examples are now run within a 'donttest{}' piece of code instead of a '\dontrun{}' one.
        o A maximum of two cores is used in all examples, even if the number of cores available is much larger than that (required by CRAN)
        o RFmerge.Rd: '\value' tag was added, explaining the returning object of the function.
        o Hengl et al. (2018) was added as a reference' did not match any file(s) known to git.

0.1-2   18-Dec-2019
        o The package was built using the '--compact-vignettes="gs+qpdf"'  to avoid the following WARNIG from CRAN: "'gs+qpdf' made some significant size reductions".

0.1-1   18-Dec-2019
        o Full PDF vignette was replaced by a  minimal RMarkdown version to avoid dependencies from rgdal, hydroTSM, and hydroGOF.

0.1-0   15-Dec-2019
        o First release
        o It depends on R >= 3.5.0 because serialized objects (.rds data files) in serialize/load version 3 cannot be read in older versions
        o RMarkdown vignette was replaced by a sttic PDF  one to avoid dependencies from rgdal, hydroTSM, and hydroGOF.
